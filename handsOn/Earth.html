    <h3> Fun Facts about Earth</h3>
    <p>Earth is a colorful planet that looks mostly blue because of its oceans, with green and brown land for plants and animals. It’s the only planet we know of that has life, thanks to the air we breathe!</p>
    <p>Did you know it takes 24 hours for Earth to spin once? That’s what gives us day and night! When the Sun is up, it warms us, and at night, it cools down. Earth has all kinds of weather, from snowy mountains to sunny beaches!</p>
