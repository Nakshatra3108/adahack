    <h3> Fun Facts about Mars</h3> 
    <p>Mars is known as the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance, which comes from iron oxide (basically rust) on its surface. Pretty cool, right?</p> 
    <p>One awesome fact is that Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, called Olympus Mons. It's about three times taller than Mount Everest!</p> 
    <p>And here's a mind-blowing fact â€” Mars has seasons like Earth! But they last much longer because a year on Mars is almost twice as long as a year on Earth. Imagine having double the time for your favorite season!</p>
    <h4>Questions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Would you like to hike on Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system?</li>
        <li>If you could live on Mars, what season would you want to experience twice as long?</li> 
        <li>What do you think it would be like to see the red landscape of Mars every day?</li>
        </ul>
