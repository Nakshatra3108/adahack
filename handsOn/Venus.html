    <h3> Fun Facts about Venus</h3> 
    <p>Venus is often called Earth's "twin" because it's almost the same size as our planet, but don't be fooled, it's WAY different!</p>
    <p>One wild fact is that Venus has the hottest surface in our entire solar system, even hotter than Venus! That’s because its thick atmosphere traps heat, making it like a runaway greenhouse.</p>
    <p>And get this — a day on Venus is longer than its year! Yup, it takes Venus longer to rotate on its axis than it does to orbit the Sun. Imagine watching the same sunrise for months!</p>
