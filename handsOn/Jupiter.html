    <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system — it's so big that over 1,300 Earths could fit inside it!</p>
    <p>One of the coolest features of Jupiter is its Great Red Spot, a massive storm that's been raging for over 300 years! It's even bigger than Earth!</p>
    <p>And here's a fun fact — Jupiter has at least 92 moons! One of them, Ganymede, is the largest moon in the solar system, even bigger than Mercury!</p>
