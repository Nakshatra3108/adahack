    <h3> Fun Facts about Mercury</h3>
    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun, which makes it SUPER hot during the day.</p>
    <p>However, the crazy thing is, at night it can get really cold! It reaches temperatures we can't even withstand!</p>
    <p>There's also another REALLY cool fact about Mercury. Did you know that a day on Mercury is longer than on Earth? Isn’t that cool? So, if you could visit Mercury, you’d have long days and even longer nights!</p>
